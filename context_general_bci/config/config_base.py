        It seems plausible we'll want to specify the arrays to use from different datasets with some granularity.
        For example, some stim experiments really only have good sensory array data or motor array data.
        For now, we will specify this at the level of experimental task. Note though, that we need to additionally specify selection per subject.

        I will use a somewhat heavyhanded strategy for now
        - Each dataset/subject only provides some arrays (which have subject-specific hashes)
        - Configured task arrays are keys that indicate which of these arrays should be used
        - It is assumed that subjects will not have all of these - some of these arrays belong to other subjects
        - For now we will require all full explicit array names to be specified

        Additionally, we would like to be able to specify when to group arrays together or not.
        - Probably the strategy for doing this will be array group aliases
            - This alias must propagate in both meta info and data - data should be stored per meta info.
        - It may be advantageous, or may not be advantageous, to split or group arrays.
        - More tokens, especially for distant arrays, is likely useful. However, memory is quadratic in tokens.
