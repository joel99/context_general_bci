        Our preprocessing will extract putative stimulation times (`trial_stim_samples`),
        which we need to identify the true stimulation parameters for (such as channel, amplitude).
        We do need to compare timing as some (small but non-negligible) fraction of pulses are dropped.
        TODO: the most technically correct way of doing this is to extract from voltage monitor, i.e. hardware logs right before stimulation
        - We will NEED to use voltage monitor once using multi-channel stimulation.
        Right now, we're referring to the commanded parameters, assuming minimal drift and no egregious dropping (i.e. not robust to severe jitter and assuming each command has an artifact.)

        Note we only use parameters, and not timing, as command timing clearly drifts a ~2ms.
        Assuming effected stim conserves command order, we'll zip backwards.
        i.e. assuming last pulse was effected, then take next detected stim's params from the closest of remaining commands
