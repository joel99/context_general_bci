This experiment was motivated by observations that even when test-sessions were restricted to ~300 trials, we still seemed to saturate. More specifically, we needed to contextualize the quantitative changes we were seeing -- so we set up a comparison with scaling in-session, which we very much know to exist.

Hidden size is restricted in supervised learning bc in JY's experience supervised models are more sensitive to disastrous overfitting when hidden size is large (256 is large in this setting)
